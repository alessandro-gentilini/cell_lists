Fixed-Radius Nearest Neighbors Search

Cell lists algorithm partitions space into grid and sorts points into a cell in
discrete grid, allowing fast nearest neighbor searches for fixed radius because
it is only necessary to search current and neighboring cells for points instead
of the whole domain.

Examples:
    >>> points = ...
    >>> cell_size = ...
    >>> points_indices, cells_count, cells_offset, grid_shape = add_to_cells(points, cell_size)
    >>> neigh_cells = neighboring_cells(grid_shape)
    >>> cell_indices = np.arange(len(cells_count))
    >>> for i, j in find_neighbors(cell_indices, neigh_cells, points_indices, cells_count, cells_offset)
    >>>     pass

    Sorts the indices of the points into the grid by the given cell size.

    Parameters
    ----------
    points : array of floats
